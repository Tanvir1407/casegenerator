# Image Requirements for Solutions Section

## Required Images

To complete the new "Your solutions we give" section design, you need to add two professional business images:

### Image 1: business-professional-1.jpg
- **Location**: `public/images/Certificate/business-professional-1.jpg`
- **Description**: Professional businessman in business attire (suit) working or in office setting
- **Specifications**:
  - Format: JPG or PNG
  - Size: At least 800x800px (square format)
  - Quality: High resolution, professional photography
  - Style: Corporate, professional, modern
  - Subject: Male professional in navy/blue suit similar to the reference image
  
### Image 2: business-professional-2.jpg
- **Location**: `public/images/Certificate/business-professional-2.jpg`
- **Description**: Professional businessman with laptop or in consultation setting
- **Specifications**:
  - Format: JPG or PNG
  - Size: At least 800x800px (square format)
  - Quality: High resolution, professional photography
  - Style: Corporate, professional, modern, smiling/friendly
  - Subject: Male professional similar to the reference image

## Image Guidelines

1. **Professional Quality**: Use high-resolution corporate photography
2. **Consistent Style**: Both images should have similar lighting and professional aesthetic
3. **Background**: Clean, office or business environment
4. **Color Scheme**: Should complement the site's blue (#1B4E7E) and gold (#D4A736) color palette
5. **Composition**: Images will be displayed in circular frames, so ensure the subject is centered

## Recommended Sources

- Stock photo sites: Unsplash, Pexels, Shutterstock, Adobe Stock
- Search keywords: "professional businessman", "corporate executive", "business consultant", "businessman office"

## Alternative Option

If you prefer to use existing images from the Certificate folder temporarily:
- Rename/copy suitable images to the required filenames
- The design will still work, but professional photos matching the description will look better

## Implementation Notes

Once you have the images:
1. Place both JPG files in: `d:\Omega-Solution\casagenerators\public\images\Certificate\`
2. Name them exactly as specified: `business-professional-1.jpg` and `business-professional-2.jpg`
3. Refresh your browser to see the new design

The circular frame styling with decorative accent circles will automatically be applied.
